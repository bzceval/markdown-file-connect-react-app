# Demystifying HTTP Status Codes: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction
In the world of web development and server-client interactions, **HTTP status codes** play a critical role. They act as messengers between web servers and clients, conveying essential information about the outcome of a request. This blog post will take you on a deep dive into the realm of HTTP status codes, unraveling their meanings, significance, and practical implications.

## Understanding HTTP Status Codes
HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers grouped into five classes, each representing a specific category:

1. **Informational (1xx):** These codes provide provisional responses and are rarely encountered. An example is "100 Continue," indicating the server has received the initial part of the request.

2. **Success (2xx):** These codes signify successful request processing. The well-known "200 OK" falls into this category, confirming a successful response.

3. **Redirection (3xx):** These codes prompt the client to take additional action. "301 Moved Permanently" suggests the requested resource has permanently moved.

4. **Client Errors (4xx):** These codes indicate errors caused by the client's request. "404 Not Found" suggests the server couldn't find the requested resource.

5. **Server Errors (5xx):** These codes signal server-side errors. "500 Internal Server Error" indicates an unexpected issue on the server.

## Common HTTP Status Codes and Their Meanings
Here are some frequently encountered HTTP status codes and their meanings:

- **200 OK:** Request successful; server returns the requested data.
- **201 Created:** New resource created as a result of the request.
- **400 Bad Request:** Server couldn't understand the request due to client error.
